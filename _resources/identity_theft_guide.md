## Identity Theft Guide

This guide explains how identity theft happens, how to recognize it, and what to do if you’re affected.

### What is Identity Theft?
Identity theft happens when someone uses your personal or financial information without your permission. This information can include:
* Names and addresses
* Credit card or Social Security numbers
* Bank account numbers
* Medical insurance account numbers

### What to Do Immediately
Contact law enforcement.

### Reporting & Recovery Resources

To report identity theft, contact:
* The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) online at IdentityTheft.gov or call 1-877-438-4338
* The three major credit reporting agencies. Ask them to place fraud alerts and a credit freeze on your accounts.
* The fraud department at your credit card issuers, bank, and other places where you have accounts


### How to Recover Your Funds After a Loss from Scams

To begin the recovery process, you’re going to need to report the losses. This is a guide for those in the US. You will want to first file a police report at your local police station as well as a complaint at the government agencies listed below:

Your local policy agency
* Your State Attorney General
* Identity Theft: https://www.identitytheft.gov/
* FBI IC3: https://complaint.ic3.gov/default.aspx
* SEC: https://www.sec.gov
* CFTC: https://www.cftc.gov
* FTC: https://www.ftc.gov
* FinCen: https://www.fincen.gov
* US Secret Service: https://www.secretservice.gov/contact/field-offices
<i>Note: the agencies that you report to may depend on the nature of the scam. Start with your local police.</i>

### How to Report to Your Financial Institution

When filing a complaint with your financial institution, make sure to ask them to:

* Close the account and open a new account with all new account numbers.
* Report any digital wallets that you use (Apple Pay/Google Pay/Samsung Pay).
* Report any other digital payment methods that you use (Paypal, Zelle, etc).
* Update your contact information.
* Withdraw any cash that you need to survive in the interim.
* Because the account representatives may not remember or even know to ask you!

Remember to:

* Keep a call log and timeline.
* Visit your financial institution in person if possible and bring your documents (i.e. government-issued ID, police report).
* Place a credit freeze with Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.
* Place a security report with Chex Systems. www.chexsystems.com.
* Change your payroll information with your employer.
* Consider consulting with legal support.
