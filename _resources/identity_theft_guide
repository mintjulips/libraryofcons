How to Recover Your Funds After a Loss from Scams

To begin the recovery process, you’re going to need to report the losses. This is a guide for those in the US. You will want to first file a police report at your local police station as well as a complaint at the government agencies listed below:

Your local policy agency
Your State Attorney General
Identity Theft: https://www.identitytheft.gov/
FBI IC3: https://complaint.ic3.gov/default.aspx
SEC: https://www.sec.gov
CFTC: https://www.cftc.gov
FTC: https://www.ftc.gov
FinCen: https://www.fincen.gov
US Secret Service: https://www.secretservice.gov/contact/field-offices
Note: the agencies that you report to may depend on the nature of the scam.

When filing a complaint with your financial institution, make sure to ask them to:

Close the account and open a new account with all new account numbers.
Report any digital wallets that you use (Apple Pay/Google Pay/Samsung Pay).
Report any other digital payment methods that you use (Paypal, Zelle, etc).
Update your contact information.
Withdraw any cash that you need to survive in the interim.
Because the account representatives may not remember or even know to ask you!

Remember to:

Keep a call log and timeline.
Visit your financial institution in person if possible and bring your documents (i.e. government-issued ID, police report).
Place a credit freeze with Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.
Place a security report with Chex Systems. www.chexsystems.com.
Change your payroll information with your employer.
Consider consulting with legal support.
